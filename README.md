# Sharpgorithms

A set of data structures and algorithms which are easy to understand. These concepts are sometimes hard to understand as implementations generally involve performance optimizations that makes the code complex.

By avoiding these kind of optimizations, the data structures and algorithms are implemented in a way that they reflect their nature better. After one understands the basics of these concepts, they can learn and apply these optimizations on their own later on, understanding their role in increasing performance.
